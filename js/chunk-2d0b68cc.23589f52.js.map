Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.

Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).',\n    'Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.

From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.',\n    'Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.

By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.',\n    'Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.',\n    'If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.',\n    'Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities.
