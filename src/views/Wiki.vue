    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">Coronavirus</a> disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection">infectious disease</a> caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
      It was first identified in December 2019 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan">Wuhan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_China">China</a>, and has since spread globally, resulting in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">ongoing pandemic</a>.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title">What're the symptoms?</h1>
    <p>
      Common symptoms include fever, cough, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath">shortness of breath</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia">loss of smell</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageusia">taste</a>.
      Complications may include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and acute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome">respiratory distress syndrome</a>.
      The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
      There is no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine">known vaccine</a> or specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug">antiviral treatment</a>. Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title">How does it spread?</h1>
    <p>
      The virus is primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)">spread</a> between people during close contact, most often via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_droplet">small droplets</a> produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking.
      The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_disease">travelling through air</a> over long distances. Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.
      It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.
